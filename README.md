# Music Api

## Introduction

This is a json web service that allow to manage an online music store. The items are stored in a MongoDB database. I have used MongoDB Atlas to store my data. 

## Solution used

The items are store in a MongoDB cloud database. To communicate with this database, I have designed Python scripts and I have used the Flask library. This allow me to make PUT, POST or GET request to manage the database.

I have created four Python scripts : 
 
 - api.py is the main script. This is the script which take the request and use several functions to get data from the database.
 
 - albums
